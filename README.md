# Distance-Estimation-in-iPhone-New
 
This is an iPhone App where we are interested to see how people can judge distance of a life size human avatar if we add a side-by-side walking animation to it at various distances. The avatar will walk around 10 meters, 25 meters, and 40 meters. The user first needs to scan the ground when the app will start running in the iPhone. Whenever the floor is detected properly up to the farthest possible distance by the iPhone, he/she needs to tap anywhere on the detected floor by the app, and baam, the avatar will start walking around 10 meters ahead of the user. To teleport the avatar at various distances, the user only needs to tap on the iPhone screen every time. The App will teleport the avatar at various distances randomly. This randomness is incorporated to reduce the ordering effect. To get an optimal experience, it is recommended to use a tripod while using this app to judge the distance of the walking avatar.

A small Demo can be found here...

Here you can see the iPhone app, as well as the same app running in a HoloLens as well, using HoloToolKit.
